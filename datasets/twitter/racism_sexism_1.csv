"6671","neither","@spacekatgal we could do something fun with this. i could see how many tweets you get from users you've blocked."
"6672","neither","The goal here is to eventually have up a pretty dashboard where you can go and see up-to-the-minute stats on this stuff."
"6673","neither","I'm starting to get a grasp for when the notification ugliness is going to happen, so it could be an interesting incident notification tool."
"6674","neither","however, it doesn't scale. i can use this to track up to a certain number of users. if they target a user i'm not looking at, won't work."
"6675","neither","it would be possible with a super low retention for graphs, i guess, and *.wsp files that are deleted if they aren't updated in N minutes?"
"6676","neither","but that seems gross, and not really how this tool should be used. can do better w/other things, this is more for an overview."
"6677","neither","@cheeseplus @obfuscurity wsp is... sigh. but i'm just using docker in aws with a grafana image. fuck configuring this crap."
"6678","neither","@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i got statsd/graphite working on freebsd once, but then i switched to connected line graphs and it crashed?!"
"6679","neither","@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i don't wanna devops this. i just want it to work so i can do other things. i need a devops."
"6680","neither","@cheeseplus yeah. i'm kind of feeling like for what i'm doing, wsp is ok. for doing more granular monitoring, redis would be good."
"6681","neither","@cheeseplus no pretty graphs easily generated out of redis, tho. i'd have to learn R or somesuch."
"6682","neither","@Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn oh dear"

"6686","neither","@vex0rian @Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn or it's not responding to kill signals. weeeeird. because i ran the script manually and it worked."
"6687","neither","@vex0rian @Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn getting into inst is slow. it's oomed. prob going to have to aws console and kick it."
"6688","neither","@ctmf they are already setting up  bots to tweet with the hashtag to inflate it. i don't really see this making much of a difference."
"6689","neither","@ctmf but if they do, i'm happy to turn my graphs over to twitter's abuse department. i don't think the people i'm watching would risk that."
"6690","neither","@Faythemage @motavate i love those too much. TOO MUCH."

"6696","neither","I just saw that 3 people requested that I update my Amazon Wish-List. Hm. I usually only use it to track things I plan on buying eventually."

"6711","neither","@GemmaNoon it's what i'm *trying* to do, at least targeting specific groups/causes. it's tricky. have to look more at statistics than words."
"6712","neither","@GemmaNoon ie: things not as open for interpretation, such as numeric or boolean data (is following/is not following, etc)."
"6713","neither","@GemmaNoon it's really fun watching patterns emerge in all of this regarding various groups. i think it'll be useful."
"6714","neither","@GemmaNoon rather amused that despite their protests, GG is the only group i've looked at where abuse is easily predicted based on followers"
"6715","neither","@sschinke @TsundereRager previous versions of ebooks_example (code using twitter_ebooks) wouldn't reply to *_ebooks accounts."

"6721","neither","verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have."
"6722","neither","however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients."
"6723","neither","the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists. eng/infra is already there. expose if a # has been added via metadata."
"6724","neither","add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update, natch)."
"6725","neither","does have some drawbacks. but a 2nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than N days' is easy. metadata already exists. client/policy update."
"6726","neither","phone # idea isn't perfect (it's easy enough to grab a phone # from GV), but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse."
"6727","neither","in short, there needs to be a verified that isn't Verified. requiring govt ids will cause probs. unique phone less problematic, not perfect."
"6728","neither","don't worry, i'm sure no one will be like ""WHAT A GREAT IDEA"" until a dude takes credit for it. &lt;3"
"6729","neither","@tomdcc a lot of people don't have cell phones. i was one of them for 2 years. ;) i only used GV. against the idea of disallowing GV."

"6732","neither","@eDRoaCH unaware of their issues. do they not have cell phones/access to GV?"
"6733","neither","@eDRoaCH i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for SMS."
"6734","neither","@eDRoaCH @orvtech this isn't de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn't necessarily be stored. no names would be required."
"6735","neither","@tomdcc it's very easy to change your GV #."
"6736","neither","it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity."

"6745","neither","@tomdcc oh god that sounds like a horrible idea. privacy problems. also, twitter likely wouldn't be storing the number. that would be bad."
"6746","neither","i'm still entertained that jason's idea is to either pay a fee or make your acct protected. i'd love to hear his thoughts on short skirts."

"6758","neither","@Spacekatgal it makes sense to ask for donations to keep it up and going, and to pay for the dev work. ideally, this is 100% crowd-funded."
"6759","neither","@Spacekatgal this is more from a consumer side, though. from a business side? one could see email SPAM as falling under that category."

"7965","neither","In many states, we've got laws that specifically protect against this kind of thing. However, they aren't enforced due to education/funding."
"7966","neither","Feelings about the person involved need to be separated from the real issue, which is advocacy, education, law, and tools."

"8073","neither","@ShriekAPotomos if not anonymous, then at the very least, privileged information."

"8075","neither","@beardyblue @emily_esque &amp; possibly being able to provide referrals for people that want someone to help them navigate reporting to PD"
"8076","neither","@beardyblue @emily_esque police tend to take reports of online harassment/threats a lot more seriously when a lawyer is involved."

"8164","neither","Oh, hell. Is Blizzard proxying tweets instead of sending the tweet content directly to twitter from the WoW client?"
"8165","neither","I guess that's one way to get around the user token count limitation per app ID."
"8166","neither","I need to think about this. I don't think I like this."
"8167","neither","I think the biggest problem I have with it is that there's too much of a reliance on WoW services for an external mechanism."
"8168","neither","Blizzard has had issues in the past with certain things being delayed (achievements, D3). I would strongly dislike a tweet being delayed."
"8169","neither","I'm still not 100% certain this is happening. But the delay between sending a tweet and seeing it appear is far too long."
"8170","neither","KISS (keep it simple, stupid) very much applies to designing a new feature. If Blizzard is proxying tweets, that's unnecessary and bad."

"8185","neither","At this moment in time, I am unaware of any effort he has made into this space. I'm tied in w/many orgs. His name has never once come up."
"8186","neither","He's been offered contact info from those he's speaking with should he care to contribute. He's utilized none of this. I am unimpressed."
"8187","neither","If you're interested in working on solutions, we'd love to have your help. However, I can spot a flail for media attention from a mile away."
"8188","neither","Don't think that it won't go unnoticed/unchallenged. Don't put on a cape unless you plan on being a hero. It's not a photo op. It's a job."
"8189","neither","@GavinRamblesOn what this person has done is not just voiced an opinion. i'm not going to get a pile-on going, so i'm not giving specifics."
"8190","neither","Since this was questioned, I should be clear. I'm not talking about supporters, or just people with opinions."
"8191","neither","I'm talking about people that take an active stand to say they want to create solutions for harassment, but do nothing beyond get RTed."
"8192","neither","For everyone that is involved in this space, there's a huge personal risk. People get targeted. Friends and family get targeted."
"8193","neither","Frankly, it's a little irritating to see some guy with a huge following come along and say ""I'm gonna do stuff!"" and then... do nothing."
"8194","neither","Or, well, something happened. A hashtag was started by harassers to support him. So, that's something. I guess."

"8209","neither","@KaitlynBurnell the use of the word 'bully' in this context is worrisome and relevant to any conversation i have."
"8210","neither","@KaitlynBurnell given the *massive* glee i'm seeing from GG irt that tweet, it's concerning that he's not retracting or explaining 'bully'"

"8251","neither","@Ethelmonster @ninaburleigh @wadhwa lol, she was one of the people that gave him a platform and then ignored detractors."
"8252","neither","According to @ninaburleigh, we should be happy that dudes are talking about feminism. Even if they are telling us how we are doing it wrong."
"8253","neither","This is 50 shades of bullshit. Wadhwa said that women that disagreed with him were just looking for attention. THESE WERE HIS WORDS."

"8270","neither","Sorry, I'm not going to say GamerGate is the same as ISIS, and you can shove your donation up your ass. @PeerWorker"
"8271","neither","I don't change my views to get money. That's not how this works. @PeerWorker"
"8272","neither","@jlorry96 he also makes claims of racism if someone calls him on repeatedly using feminist terms incorrectly. i. don't. care."
"8273","neither","@PeerWorker this is what you just said. you just compared online harassment to mutilated bodies. this is demeaning."
"8274","neither",".@PeerWorker online harassment is a serious problem, and it needs to be addressed. but making false equivalencies won't get you anywhere."
"8275","neither","Let me make this super fucking clear. I will not compromise my beliefs in any way just to get donations. That isn't happening, ever."
"8276","neither","I appreciate every donation received. But ppl that threaten to pull funding if I don't say the things they want to hear can fuck themselves."
"8277","neither","@PeerWorker @krisaubuchon holy shit. seriously? i've done research into both groups. I've seen the tweets &amp; patterns. GamerGate isn't ISIS."
"8278","neither","No one said threats weren't serious. However, there's a difference between ISIS and GamerGate. @PeerWorker"
"8279","neither","You're not going to get the response you're looking for. Give up. @PeerWorker"

"8400","neither","Until twitter provides us with a way to filter new accounts or provides a higher barrier to entry, these are just words that mean little."
"8401","neither","The Developer Policy needs an update that allows us to filter non-promoted tweets. Twitter clients continue to have bugs w/large block lists"

"8444","neither","It's easy to think that our experiences are indicative of everyone's experiences. I've fallen victim to that thinking before."
"8445","neither","Unfortunately, a positive experience doesn't cancel out a negative. And playing the ""cool girl"" game isn't a good look for anyone."

"8481","neither","There's a reason we started tracking all of her followers. An immense amount of racism/sexism/abuse was coming from her corner."
"8482","neither","The thing is, you don't actually have to say any of that stuff for us to figure out who it's coming from. It's easy to track social groups."
"8483","neither","So she can try &amp; claim innocence, but statistics paint her as being someone to avoid. And I've been in her sights for a while. Oh well."
"8484","neither","@freebsdgirl  Ignore fools. Embrace the term ""bitch"". It means you have strength and express your own opinions. ""Bitch"" is a badge of honor."

"8507","neither","UNIX logins are restricted to 8 characters, darling. FreeBSD uses SVN, not git. I believe SVN history is imported to github."
"8508","neither","And then there's this person, who suggests PC-BSD because FreeBSD are all sjws. https://t.co/ubnhhv9yQ0"
"8509","neither","PC-BSD is a fork that is mostly funded by iXSystems, the organization that runs FreeBSD marketing. It's a frontend on top of FreeBSD."

"8536","neither","BSD is a good community. Wandering into it and attacking one of the few women contributors is going to get some people talking."

"8538","neither","I have never felt more supported and safe than I do around the FreeBSD developer community. They are amazing, and I love them."
"8539","neither","The smear tactics aren't going to work. These people have known me for over a decade."
"8540","neither","So far, the primary response I've heard from the FreeBSD dev community in regards to all of this is ""how can we help?"""
"8541","neither","And I've asked them to stay uninvolved. But attacking my work with them? GLHF. You're bringing it on yourself."
"8542","neither","It's been several years since I've contributed code. This was due to a conflict with an employer. I *asked* for my commit bit to be retired."

"8764","neither","It's a really tough problem, because it's a BIG problem. It is far reaching. It has many different forms."

"8766","neither","You aren't just one person. There are many of us, and we all have voices. But more than that, we have resources, experience, and passion."
"8767","neither","You aren't alone in this. You're never alone in this."

Wired | Curbing Online Abuse Isn't Impossible, Here's Where We Start http://t.co/MJEj6niarc"
"9212","neither","They have been testing/perfecting a terrorism formula to ruin target's lives, attempt to get them murdered or drive them to kill themselves."
"9213","neither","First step is doxxing and death threats, which immediately destabilizes the target's most fundamental sense of safety and security."
"9214","neither","It creates the isolation needed for longer-term campaigns (100s of threatening, abusive, harassing messages per hour) to have max. impact."
"9215","neither","This causes lasting trauma that will not only temporarily silence but forever change the target's sense of safety and support in speaking."
"9216","neither","They then start digging in detail through your past to ""find""/""invent"" things to justify harassing you and get more ammo."
"9217","neither","This has the nice bonus effect of ""proving"" to your ""community"" that you deserve harassment and aren't worth supporting = more isolation."
"9218","neither","That campaign signals to any stalkers, past partners, etc. that now is the time to GET THEM. This often means cyber sexual assault &amp; DV."
"9219","neither","If ANYONE is defending you at this point, the same techniques are applied to supporters to make sure that stops."
"9220","neither","The message is clear: This target *WILL* be left COMPLETELY ISOLATED as we torture, terrorize and abuse them with impunity... or else"
"9221","neither","This systemized terrorism creeps closer and closer into the tech community, we are becoming the new hunting grounds."
"9222","neither","We have been IGNORING this because it was happening to the most marginalized users of our software and tools."
"9223","neither","I'm in south bay and available after 3 PM if any other companies/people would like to meet up."
"9224","neither","Gaters have started spamming @join_oapi instead of this account. It's cool, I'm modifying ggautoblocker to use mute just for that acct. ^.^"
"9225","neither","Funfact: ""Redhat"" is the name of a company. GG should consider that before calling @freebsdgirl racist #StopGamerGate http://t.co/eq4LSkTqwJ"

"9234","neither","If the past 6mo have taught us anything, it's that attaching your name to anti-harassment gets yourself targeted for more harassment."
"9235","neither","@elplatt yes"
"9236","neither","@Skawtnyc @gregtitus  that's a relief."
"9237","neither","@KuraFire yeah, that's my only concern. Being a nonprofit gives us a lot of restrictions."

"9239","neither","@Shervyn I have one. I just have to talk to them. Mostly musing."
"9240","neither","@Shervyn I think the biggest challenge going forward in the near future is going to be securing funding."
"9241","neither","@Shervyn A big project we have going forward is a user facing solution that involves the cooperation of large tech companies."
"9242","neither","@Shervyn I don't have a problem getting tech companies involved. The concern is just funding everything."
"9243","neither","@Shervyn I need to be less uncomfortable talking about money. I don't like asking for it. Really bad at that."
"9244","neither","@Shervyn I don't have to do it, but given that it's such a high priority, I need to put some time into it until we have it figured out."
"9245","neither","@Shervyn i don't even know what that is! oh gosh."
"9246","neither","@Aiiane i can't wait! :)  it's going to be awesome. great meeting with you."
